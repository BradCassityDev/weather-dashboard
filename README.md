## Weather Dashboard

## Overview:
This application allows users to enter a city that is then used to dynamically compile a URL to interact with an OpenWeather API endpoint. Nested fetches allow for the user to type the city name, which is then converted to latitude and longitude that are then used to compiled a second URL to fetch another resource from OpenWeather to grab the current and future forecast for that particular city. The UI design allows users to see all relevant data in one dashboard layout for ease of use. Users can also view a history of their previous 10 searches to quickly reference them again if needed. 

## Built With:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Javascript (MomentJS)

## Usage:
Users can type a city name into the search field to see relevant weather forecasts for both the current and five future days. A search history is saved that contains the users previous 10 searches for ease of use.
